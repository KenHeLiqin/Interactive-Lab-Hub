# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Sitting too long has become the unhealthy byproduct of our modern life. Students often sit for hours when studying; most white-collar workers, engineers, and designers sit and stare at the screen for most of their working hours. Many of us are well aware of the detrimental health effects for sitting too much, and we want to change. 

A chair that glows different color of light to remind people the amount of time they have sit  might be a suitable tool. The chair is normal when it is empty. After a person sit for 30 minutes, the armrest glows dim white light. As that person sit for longer, the light become brighter. After two hours, the light turns yellow, reminding the person that he or she has sat for too long. After 4 hours, the light turn red, giving the sense of urgency to stand up. 

Light is a good medium for this reminder because 1) light's presence can be continuous. Apple watch have a function that remind people to stand up by pushing a notification. However, it is unlikely that the moment of the arrival of the notification is the moment people can stand up. For example, if the notification arrives when people are writing emails, they are unlikely to stop their work and stand up even though they agree they should stand up. After writing the email, people often forgot about the reminder and jump to the next task. The continous presence of light can be constant reminder that it is time to stand up. 2) Light is not too salient that it distracts people. For sound, if the chair start beeping, people might be annoyed. However, people might be able to notice the light while still feeling comfortable to continue working.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

The light might still be annoying to people, so they will turn it off.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

When people are trying to focus on the work on the screen, the constant light reminder that they need to stand up is a bit annoying.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

The link below is for the intial set-up video.
[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gTOhumrUucZF266K_e280N_XXyecaX0l/view?usp=sharing)

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

Create a clear space on the armrest to place the light stripe inside, so that the light source is not directly in contact with the arms.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

The feedbacks I got are 1) it is ok for the interaction to be more intrusive since it should act as a push for people to stand up. 2) If people find the light annoying, the chair can have button. When peole want to express "they acknolwedge the reminder, but they still want to continue to work", they can push the button.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*


## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ This interaction happens on the chair of people's main work station. It happens when people sit for too long.

_Players:_ This device is designed for people who often sit for extended of time during works but realize sitting for too long is not desirable because of back pain, neck pain, eye strain, etc. They concern about those problems but often forget to stand up and walk around when they are so focused on their work and do not realize the passage of time. 

_Activity:_ The device is a chair have two main functions: 1) reminds people to stand up and 2) help people to maintain a good posture. 

1) The chair have one group of pressure sensor on the seat. The sensor can detect if a person sit down. Once a person sit down, the chair start to time how long that person has sat. After 30 minutes, the chair’s armrest will start to glow dim white light. As time passes, the white light will become brighter and brighter. After 2 hours, the light gradually turns yellow. After 3 hours, the light turns into red to signal the sense of urgency to stand. Once that person stand up, the light will gradually fade away. The light will completely gone dark after that person leave the chair for 5 minutes. The intensity of the light allow that person to be conscious about how long they have sat.
2) The chair have another group of sensor on the backrest. Those sensor can analyze the sitting posture of that person. Since a good sitting posture is to lean our back against the backrest, if those sensor on the backrest does not detect that person, it means that person is sitting in a bad posture. Then chair will then vibrate to notify that person. This interaction is much more intrusive than the light because having a bad posture put severe stress on our body and it is much easier for that person to adjust.

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
